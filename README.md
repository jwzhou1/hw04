How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment (estimate)? 

Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell us who and in what capacity.  
- one per row, add more if needed  
No.

Did you use any external resources (you do not have to cite in class material)? (Cite them below)  
- one row per resource  
    For writing my_dll.h file, I used the following external resources:  
    https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/doubly_linked_list_program_in_c.htm

(Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment? 

(Optional) How would you improve the assignment? 

## Understanding Time Complexity

1. Using a markdown table and markdown/latex math, show the BigO for Arrays, Singly Linked Lists, Doubly Linked Lists (so total of 3). For the columns, you will look at the Worst Case Time Complexity for Access, Search/Find, Insertion, and Deletion. 

2. Usually for singly and doubly linked lists, we reference both the head and tail for speed considerations. What would be the cost if you only had your head referenced, and you wanted to push to the tail of either?  $O(?)$

3. Name an example where an array is better than a linked list, and an example where a linked list is better than an array. Make sure to reference the big O as part of your reasoning. 


Note: Make sure look at your finished markdown in the browser hosted on github or via a markdown preview extension. To confirm the notation is showing up properly. Double check the resources section in the instructions if you need help with markdown tables.
